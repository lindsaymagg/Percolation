"In this assignment, you will write a program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation. In doing so, you will better understand depth-first-search, union-find structures, and the use of computer simulations for statistical inquiry. Your goal will be to explore trade-offs in several approaches to estimate the percolation threshold in an NxN system."
